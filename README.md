Project-Euler
=============

These are my solutions to Project Euler, which is found at http://projecteuler.net/

I'm going to try and solve a few each day or in my spare time, as a nice and simple way of refreshing myself on programming languages that I haven't used in a while.

Each problem is solved in Python.
